1. What is the Design Pattern you have used in writing the tests in the Framework?
Our Framework was based on Selenium  from POM
a)Page Object Model -->Each class file will contain only corresponding web page elements
b) it is subset - Page Factory - (the initElements method is used to initialize web elements.
@findBy-- to find web elements using different locators
@FindBy(id="elementId") WebElement element;
constructor

2. How are reusable utilities handled within the framework?
wait for item element to or spinner to disappear  or page , go to cart
we use an Abstract method
For all selenium methods we making sure one abstract class the go to handle
for example : wait to element to appear, go to cart ...
Question: how are u reusing them in all classes?
basically we are inheriting that reusable method class into all over
page object class

Base test common rescales methods (log to application



3. Where did you use Inheritance OOPS Concept in your framework?
refer to what we did q2  - mention post request and

4. How did you drive the data from external files in the framework?
json file to pass the data
In TestNG there concept @DataProvider  - can access hash maps as an objects to sent the data
we wrote a method that convert jason file in hash maps
once it is converted that hush map object then gets passed  back @DataProvider

we use Jaskon databind methods to String to hashmap (objectMapper)


5. Did you use Interfaces in the framework? If so, what is the scope of it?
Listeners.java that implements ITestListener()  is an interface
WebDriver is also Interfaces

6. How are you achieving Encapsulation in the framework?
We are hiding our "private" fields and only exposing our actions methods to public


7. Does your Framework Support Parallel Runs? How are you writing Thread safe code?
<suite parallel -- test  threadLocal - store information as thread ID

8. Do you have static keywords in the framework? If so, its usage?
not used

9. How are you sending Global Properties to your test at run time?
in our base test we used a Property class file reading any into ou
GlobalData.properties   loading the file at runtime and according o the oprtion
URL / time out / brower namei can drive it from maven with getProperty()

10. What is the mechanism you use to run only selected set of tests inside the framework?
We are using TestNG groups tests with annotation by marking the class wth groups
and in our pom we define profile with group to run


11. How are you handling Flaky tests in the framework?
there is interface in TestNG called IRetryAnalyzer,
add another helper attribute alled IRetryAnalyzer

12. Does your Framework take Screenshot on test
Listeners.java that implements ITestListener()
catch and and print the pic to the output directory
