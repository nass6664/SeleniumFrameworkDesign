    Cucumber        Java - TestNG -> Cucumber (high level concepts)

    TestNG is an open-source test automation framework for Java.
    It is developed on the same lines as JUnit and NUnit.

    Cucumber:
    Framework executes automated acceptance tests written in the
    “Gherkin” language. Gherkin is a domain-specific
    language for behavior descriptions. Gherkin is business-readable.

    Cucumber test automation makes use of two important files:

   1. Feature file – Contains code written in Gherkin (plain English text)
   2. Step definition file – Contains the actual code written by the developer
   3. Test Runner File: In Cucumber, the test runner file executes the

    Cucumber feature files and coordinates the steps defined
    in those feature files with the corresponding step definitions.



/***********************************************************************/
Example: Pop up messaged is displayed when buttons are clicked and errors are gone
this can be interpreted differently by QA or Developer or any person.

Developer :Pop up message is displayed and errors are gone on button clicked
QA- Pop up message is displayed -Only when buttons are clicked and errors are gone
Keywords Used in Cucumber: Scenario, Feature, Feature file, Scenario outline, Step Definition
Scenarios:


/***********************************************************************/
In Cucumber Testcases are represented as Scenarios.
Scenarios contain Steps which are equivalent to test Steps and use the following keywords (Gherkin syntax) to denote them: Given, When, Then, But, and And (case sensitive).
Given: Preconditions are mentioned in the Given keyword
When: The purpose of the When Steps is to describe the user action.
Then: The purpose of Then Steps is to observe the expected output. The observations should b related to the business value/benefit of your Feature description.
I
Scenario: Make Minimum Due payment
Given user is on Pay credit card page
When user fills all details and select Minimum amount option
And User clicks on Pay button
Then Credit Card confirmation page is displayed



When we specify a business requirement, sometimes there are multiple pre and expected outcomes
